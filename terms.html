            <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

<p align="center">
    <strong><u>Gone</u></strong>
    <br>
    <strong><u>Terms of Use</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS AND ALSO LIMITS THE
        REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    These Terms of Use (the “<u>Terms</u>”) govern your use of the ProductGram, Inc. (“<u>PG</u>”) service available through our website located at <a href="http://thegoneapp.com/">http://www.thegoneapp.com</a> (the “<u>Website</u>”), and software application entitled “<em>Gone</em>” (the “<u>App</u>”) that enables you to sell, donate and dispose of your
    personal items (collectively, the functionality provided by the App referred to as the “<u>Service</u>”). <strong> </strong>By browsing our Website,
    downloading and installing the App or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these Terms and agree to be bound by them. If
    not, do not download or use the App or Service.
</p>
<p>
    PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING, BROWSING OR USING THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE, CLICKING ON THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE
    REGISTRATION PROCESS, AND/OR DOWNLOADING THE APP, YOU REPRESENT (1) THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT WITH PG, AND (2) YOU HAVE THE
    AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THE TERMS OF USE PERSONALLY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY YOU REPRESENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU
    MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE, APP OR SERVICES.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Registration. </strong>
</p>
<p>
a. <u>Member Accounts</u>. To use certain features of the Service, you must download and install the App and then register and create an account (“    <u>Account</u>”). To be eligible to create an Account, you must be at least 18 years old. When you set up your account, you will be required to create
    log-in credentials by providing certain types of personal information (“<u>Login Credentials</u>”). For more information on the types of personal
    information we will collect in order to create your Login Credentials, please review our <u>Privacy Policy</u>. You are responsible for maintaining the
    confidentiality of your Login Credentials, and are solely responsible for all activities that occur using your Login Credentials. You agree not to allow a
    third party to use your Login Credentials at any time. We reserve the right to terminate any username and password, which we reasonably determine may have
    been used by an unauthorized third party.
</p>
<p>
    b. <u>Third Party Accounts</u>. You may also link your Account with certain third party provider sites, including, but not limited to, Facebook and Amazon,
    (a “<u>Third Party Account</u>”) by either (i) providing your Third Party Account login information to us; or (ii) allowing us to access your Third Party
    Account, if permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to
    disclose your Third Party Account login information to us and/or grant us access to your Third Party Account without breach by you of any of the terms and
    conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating us to pay any fees or making us subject to any usage
    limitations imposed by such third party service providers. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Account and your Third Party
    Accounts at any time by accessing the “Settings” section of the App. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED
    WITH YOUR THIRD PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. Using Gone</strong>
</p>
<p>
    a. <u>How the App Works</u>. After registering for an Account, you can list your personal items for sale, by uploading photos and/or videos of the items
    you wish to sell via the App. If we determine that we can resell your item, the App will make you an <u>contingent</u> offer (as described in further
    detail below) for your item (each, an “<u>Offer</u>”). If you accept the Offer and send us the applicable item in the box provided by PG, we will pay you
    the full amount of the Offer, if we are able to sell your item within 30 days (the “<u>Offer Period</u>”), and PG will retain all other amounts actually
    collected by PG from the sale of your item. If we are unable to sell your item during the Offer Period, we may either make you a new Offer or return the
    item to you. If you accept the new Offer, PG will re-attempt to sell your item subject to a new Offer Period. If you reject any new Offer, we will return
    the applicable item to you. All Offers are contingent on PG actually selling your item to a third party.
</p>
<p>
    However, we may not be able to resell all of the items you list on our Service. In such cases, we may offer you the option to donate or dispose of your
    items, depending on the condition of the item and the preferences of our third party donation partners. If you do decide to sell, donate or dispose of your
    item and make your item “gone”, the App will prompt you for certain information, such as your physical address, so that we can send you a box for your item
    and/or schedule a pick up time for your item.
</p>
<p>
    b. <u>Listing Conditions</u>. When listing an item (via photo or video), you agree that you are responsible for the accuracy and content of the item
    offered. If you choose to list an item via a video, you must include a voiceover that accurately describes the item, including brand names, model numbers,
    and similar information that will aid us in determining the value of your item and whether it can be resold.
</p>
<p>
    3. <strong>Licenses and Restrictions. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    a. <u>License and Restrictions</u>. PG grants you a personal, revocable, limited, non-transferable license to use the App on any iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch
    as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms and Conditions (the “<u>Usage Rules</u>”). This license does not allow you to copy,
    disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, create derivative works of, rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the App (either
    in whole or in part).
</p>
<p>
    b. <u>Updates</u>. All updates and upgrades to the App will be governed by the version of these Terms published by PG as of the date you install such
    update or upgrade. You agree, however, that we are not obligated to create or provide any support, corrections, updates, upgrades, bug fixes and/or
    enhancements of the App or for the Service. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

</p>
<p>
    a. <u>User Content</u><strong>.</strong> “<u>User Content</u>” means any and all information and content that a user submits to, or uses with, the App or
    Services (e.g., photos of items you wish to sell). You are solely responsible for your User Content. You assume all risks associated with use of your User
    Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness or usefulness by others, or any disclosure of your User Content that makes you or any third
    party personally identifiable. You hereby represent and warrant that your User Content does not violate the Acceptable Use Policy (defined below). You may
    not state or imply that your User Content is in any way provided, sponsored or endorsed by PG. Because you alone are responsible for your User Content (and
    not PG), you may expose yourself to liability if, for example, your User Content violates the Acceptable Use Policy. PG is not obligated to backup any User
    Content and User Content may be deleted at anytime. You are solely responsible for creating backup copies of your User Content if you desire. The Website
may include areas that enable you to post information, provide feedback, recommendations, reviews and comments, and otherwise interact with other users (“    <u>Community Forums</u>”). You acknowledge that any opinions, statements, recommendation, offers, advice or other information presented or disseminated on
    the Community Forums are those of their respective authors who are solely responsible and liable for their content. PG reserves the right, in its sole
    discretion, to refuse to post or remove any material submitted or posted on the Community Forums.
</p>
<p>
    b. <u>License</u><strong>.</strong> You hereby grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to PG an irrevocable, nonexclusive,
    royalty-free and fully paid, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative works of, incorporate into other
    works, and otherwise use your User Content, and to grant sublicenses of the foregoing, solely for the purposes of including your User Content in the
    Website, App and Services. You agree to irrevocably waive (and cause to be waived) any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to
    your User Content.<a name="_Ref228014212"></a>
</p>
<p>
    c. <u>Acceptable Use Policy</u><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>The following sets forth PG’s “<u>Acceptable Use Policy</u>”:
</p>
<p>
    1. You agree not to use the Website, App or Services to collect, upload, transmit, display, or distribute any User Content (i) that violates any

    software or automated agents or scripts to the Website, App or Services so as to produce multiple accounts, generate automated searches, requests and

    permission to use spiders to copy materials from the Website and App for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly
    available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials).<a name="_Ref228014214"></a>

    action against you in our sole discretion if you violate the Acceptable Use Policy or any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise create liability

    and/or reporting you to law enforcement authorities.
</p>
<p>
    f. <u>Feedback</u><strong>.</strong> If you provide PG any feedback or suggestions regarding the App or Services (“<u>Feedback</u>”), you hereby assign to
    PG all rights in the Feedback and agree that PG shall have the right to use such Feedback and related information in any manner it deems appropriate. PG
    will treat any Feedback you provide to PG as non-confidential and non-proprietary. You agree that you will not submit to PG any information or ideas that
    you consider to be confidential or proprietary.
</p>
<p>
    5. <strong>Payment and Charges</strong>
</p>
<p>
    b. <u>Fees</u>. Joining the Service and listing an item for sale, donation or disposal is free. We do charge fees for using other services, such as
    disposing of your personal property. If you do decide to dispose of an item via the Service, we will charge your Account those fees listed in the Service
    for such disposal.
</p>
<p>
    c. <u>Payment</u>. You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a fee
    or charge is due and payable. You must provide PG with a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) (“<u>Payment Provider</u>
    ”). Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card, and you must refer to that agreement and not to these Terms to
    determine your rights and liabilities. By providing PG with your credit card number and associated payment information, you agree that PG is authorized to
    immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and payable to PG hereunder and no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to
    immediately notify PG of any change in your billing address or the credit card used for payment hereunder.
</p>
<p>
    d. <u>Taxes</u>. PG’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If any Services, or payments for any Services, under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax in
    any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to PG, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related
    penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify PG for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales
    Taxes. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid
    all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “<u>Sales Tax</u>” shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that
    PG is permitted to pass to its customers, that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise
    impose a sales or use tax
</p>
<p>
    6. <strong>Returns.</strong> PG allows returns for most items sold via the App within thirty (30) days of the date delivered according to tracking information, or if no
    tracking number was assigned to the shipment, thirty five (35) days from the date the item was shipped (the “<u>Return Period</u>”). In general you will be
    responsible if an item is returned to PG during the Return Period. For example, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if an item sold by you is
    returned to PG during the Return Period because: (a) the item did not match the description you provided; (b) the item you sold was noted as damaged by the
    domestic carrier when received; (c) the package contains the wrong or no item associated with the applicable sale made via the App; or (d) the item you
    sold requires destruction (e.g. contraband). If PG finds against you in a claim stemming from the buyer’s purchase of an item sold by you, then you will
    and agree to pay the shipping costs incurred by PG in returning the item to you, in addition to those amounts previously paid by PG to you for such item.
</p>
<p>
    7. <strong>Ownership Rights and License</strong>
</p>
<p>
a. As between you and PG, the Website and App, including any design, layout, logo, text, code, and graphics contained within the App (the “    <u>PG Content</u>”) is, and shall remain, the sole property of PG and is subject to protection under U.S. and foreign copyright laws. Other trademarks,
    logos, and images that are available in connection with our Service are the property of their respective owner (each an “<u>Owner</u>”), which may or may
    not be affiliated with, connected to, or sponsored by PG.
</p>
<p>
    b. You agree to indemnify and hold PG and PG’s Representatives harmless from and against any third-party claim, cause of action, demand or damages related
    to or arising out of: (a) the items that you list on the App; or (b) activity that occurs through or by use of your Account. This indemnification
    obligation includes payment of any attorneys' fees and costs incurred by PG.
</p>
<p>
    8.<strong> Transaction Restrictions.<a name="policy"></a> </strong>We do not take, assume, or transfer legal ownership of any items listed you request that
we hold and deliver. You acknowledge that we are not a consignee, bailee, agent, or auctioneer but merely an interactive service provider.    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    9. <strong>Termination. </strong>These Terms are effective until terminated by you or PG. Your rights under these Terms will terminate automatically
    without notice from PG if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this license. Upon termination of these Terms you shall cease all use of the Website and
    App, and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the App. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    10. <strong>No Warranty.</strong> YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE, APP AND THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WEBSITE, APP, the SERVICE, AND ANY PG content, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT
    WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND PG HEREBY DISclAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE APP, the SERVICE, AND ANY PG content, EITHER EXPRESS,
    IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INPGUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. PG DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP, the SERVICE, AND ANY PG
    content or user content, WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE APP WILL BE
    CORRECTED, or that the service will be available. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY PG OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES SHALL CREATE A
    WARRANTY.
</p>
<p>
    11. <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL PG BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE,
    EXEMPLARY, DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INclUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS
    INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WEBSITE, APP, the SERVICE, AND ANY PG
    content, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF PG HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES. In no event shall PG’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury)
    exceed the amount of ONE HUNDRED dollars ($100.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.
</p>
<p>
    12. <strong>Arbitration; Applicable Law</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    a. Except for a claim by PG against you, any and all disputes between you and PG arising under or related in any way to these Terms must be resolved
    through binding arbitration as described in this section. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly. It includes, but is not
    limited to, all claims and disputes relating to your use of the App.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>b. </strong>
    <strong>
        YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND PG ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND PG
        AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
        CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    c. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American
    Arbitration Association (“<u>AAA</u>”), as modified by this section. For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the AAA,
    you and PG must abide by the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions; and (b) the arbitration shall not
    involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a
    hearing will be determined by the AAA rules, and the hearing (if any) must take place in San Francisco, California. The arbitrator’s ruling is binding and
    may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event this agreement to arbitrate is held unenforceable by a court, then the
    disputes that would otherwise have been arbitrated shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in California. Claims of
    infringement or misappropriation of PG’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall be exclusively brought in the state and federal courts located
    in San Francisco, California.
</p>
<p>
    d. The laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules that would result in the laws of a State other than California, govern this
    license and your use of the App.
</p>
