    <strong>2. </strong>
    <strong>Types of Data We Collect. </strong>
    “<strong>Personal Data</strong>” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number,
e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “    <strong>Anonymous Data</strong>” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the
    identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(a) </strong>
    <strong>Information You Provide to Us. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    · We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail and mailing addresses, and password when you create an account to log in
    to our network (“<strong>Account</strong>”).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We may collect the unique device id number (“<strong>DID</strong>”) for the device on which you install the Application and develop a profile about you
        keyed to that DID. We may store your DID with our contact information (like your email address) when you contact us for support
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · When you list an item for sale, donation or disposal on our Service, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including
    your name, credit card information, billing information and postal address.
</p>
<p>
    · If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may store and use that information to provide you with
    location-based information and item pick-up services. If you want to deactivate this feature, you can either reinstall the Application(s) or deactivate GPS
    on your mobile device.
</p>
<p>
    · Certain Services may require our collection of your phone number. We may associate that phone number to your mobile device identification information.
</p>
<p>
    · We retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages that you store using your Account.
</p>
<p>
    · If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail,
    in order to send you a reply.
</p>
<p>
    · When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information.
</p>
<p>
    · When you post content (text, images, photographs, messages, comments or any other kind of content that is not your e-mail address) on our Website, the
    information contained in your posting will be stored on our services and other users will be able to see it.
</p>
<p>
    · We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number,
    and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Services.
</p>
<p>
    · If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or giveaway on our Website, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home number (to notify you if you
    win or not). We may also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses to verify your identity. In some situations we may need
    additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary. We recommend that
    you read the rules for each sweepstakes and contest that you enter.
</p>
<p>
    · We may also collect Personal Data, such as at other points in our Service that state that Personal Data is being collected.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(b) </strong>
    <strong>Information Collected from Third Party Accounts. </strong>
    If you login to the Services with your login credentials from certain social networking sites and other third party services (e.g. Facebook, Twitter,
    Google or Amazon) (collectively, “<strong>Third Party Providers</strong>”), we may receive Personal Data and/or Anonymous Data about you from such Third
    Party Provider, in accordance with the terms of use and privacy policy of the Third Party Provider. For example, the Services allow users to access
    Facebook to interact with friends and to share on Facebook through Wall and friends’ News Feeds. Or, Google may, with your consent, use automated means to
    scan your Google account to provide us with information about your interests and past purchases provide you with a more tailored experience. We may add
    this information to the information we have already collected from you via the Service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(c) </strong>
    <strong>Information Collected via Technology. </strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <u>Information Collected by Our Servers</u>
        . To make our Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including
        your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“<strong>IP</strong>”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when
        you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Log Files.</u>
        As is true of most websites and mobile applications, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes
        IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“<strong>ISP</strong>”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and
        clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic
        information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected
        so that when you visit the Site or the Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other
information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.        <u></u>
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Mobile Services</u>
        . We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded our Application. This information is generally used to
        help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you
        use the Application, and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event our Application crash on your mobile device, we will
        receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve
        the performance of our Application. This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used
        to identify an individual. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Cookies</u>
        . Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. <strong>“Cookies”</strong> are small pieces of information that a website sends to
        your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and
        persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Service.
        This type of information is collected to make the Service more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and
        needs. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Pixel Tag</u>
        s. In addition, we use <strong>“Pixel Tags</strong>” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images
        with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are
        stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format
        users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may
        use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ Personal Data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Traffic Analytics</u>
. We use a number of third party service provides, such as Google Analytics, to help analyze how users use the Service (“        <strong>Analytics Companies</strong>”). These Analytics Companies uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Service, what
        features they use on our Application, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Website. We use the information we get from these Analytics
        Companies only to improve our Website, Application and Services. These Analytics Companies collect only the IP address assigned to you on the date you
        visit the Service, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of
        our Analytics Companies with your Personal Data. Although these Analytics Companies may plant a persistent Cookie on your web browser or mobile device
        to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Service, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but the Analytics Company that placed the
        applicable Cookie. This Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for the Cookies used by these Analytics Companies.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>(d) </strong>
    <strong>Information Collected from Third Party Companies. </strong>
    We may obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(e) </strong>
    <strong>Location Information.</strong>
    If you have enabled location services on your phone, we collect your location information to make a map available to the recipients of your messages
    showing your location. If you do not want this information collected by us, you can disable location services on your phone.
</p>
